# 🌍 DecentraFund – Decentralized Crowdfunding on Ethereum

> Revolutionizing global innovation funding through blockchain. Transparent. Trustless. Borderless.

---

## 🚀 Overview

DecentraFund is a **Web3 crowdfunding platform** powered by **Ethereum smart contracts**, enabling creators around the globe to raise funds securely and transparently—without middlemen, high fees, or restrictions.

We’re solving the systemic failures of traditional crowdfunding by giving power back to the **creators** and **backers**. Whether you're a startup founder, a grassroots activist, or an innovator in a developing nation, **DecentraFund** opens the door to **trustless global fundraising**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Ultra-low Platform Fee**: Just 0.5%—compared to 10–15% on legacy platforms.
- ✅ **Full Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on-chain and verifiable.
- ✅ **Global Accessibility**: Anyone, anywhere can create or fund a campaign.
- ✅ **Micro-Investing**: Fund with as little as **$1**—no gatekeepers.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Creators** launch campaigns with predefined milestones.  
2. **Backers** fund the campaign using crypto.  
3. **Smart Contracts** hold the funds until each milestone is completed.  
4. If milestones are not achieved, **funds are returned to backers**.
